# willamette-natives-db
A simple html database for Willamette Valley plants for keeping track of what's what


## About Me

I'm an aspiring farmer focused on:
- Permaculture
- Agroforestry
- Silvopasture
- Plant domestication
- Genetics and breeding

This is a work-in-progress. I’m using this html to help catalog and assess species by native status, breeding potential, identifying characteristics, etc. I'm new to HTML...so some grace and feedback are super welcome!

## Current Focus Species

Especially interested in identifying natives and especially especially interested in endangered natives.
**top contenders atm:**
- Quercus garryana (Oregon white oak)
- Vaccinium spp. (Huckleberries)
- Vicia
- Lathyrus (check out Padraic J. Flood's research if you want to get excited about L. tuberosis)
- Lupinus

## Goals

- Organize information for restoration and farming planning
- Track key traits: grazing suitability, toxicity, habitat, status, else(?)
- Highlight native plants that would work good in an agroforestry setup (bonus points for pretty)


## Usage

Just open `index.html` in a browser. All functionality is self-contained.

## License

TBD – probably MIT or Creative Commons, depending on how the project evolves.
